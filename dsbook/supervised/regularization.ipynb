    "## Introduction to Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "While **linear regression** works well in many cases, it can suffer from **overfitting** when the model becomes too complex or the dataset contains noise. Overfitting occurs when a model captures not only the true underlying pattern but also random fluctuations or noise in the data. This leads to poor generalization on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to combat overfitting is to apply **regularization**, which modifies the loss function by adding a penalty for large model coefficients. The idea is to constrain the model's flexibility and encourage simpler models that generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will introduce two commonly used regularization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression** (also known as L2 regularization)\n",
    "- **LASSO Regression** (also known as L1 regularization)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)\n",
    "\n",
    "In **ridge regression**, we modify the ordinary least squares loss function by adding a penalty proportional to the square of the coefficients' magnitudes. This penalty discourages large coefficients, leading to a smoother model that is less likely to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function for ridge regression is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\mathcal{l}_{ridge} = \\sum_i \\left( f(\\mathbf{x}_i) - y_i \\right)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_j \\beta_j^2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ is a **regularization parameter** that controls the strength of the penalty. When $\\lambda = 0$, ridge regression reduces to ordinary least squares. As $\\lambda$ increases, the penalty becomes stronger.\n",
    "- $\\beta_j$ are the model coefficients (excluding the intercept).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea here is that by penalizing the size of the coefficients, we shrink them toward zero, which can help mitigate overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Does This Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization works by reducing the likelihood of overfitting through the addition of penalties for large model coefficients. In regression models, coefficients represent the strength and direction of the relationship between each feature and the target variable. When these coefficients grow large, it can indicate that the model is reacting too strongly to specific details or noise in the training data, which may not hold for new data. This is a sign of overfitting: the model has not only learned the true underlying patterns but has also fit itself to random fluctuations or specific data instances in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding penalties (as in L1 and L2 regularization), we shrink the size of the coefficients. Smaller coefficients prevent the model from placing too much importance on any one feature unless it truly adds significant predictive value. In L2 regularization (Ridge), for example, coefficients are constrained by a penalty on their squared magnitudes, which promotes a smoother fit and reduces the model’s flexibility. L1 regularization (Lasso), on the other hand, may drive some coefficients all the way to zero, effectively performing feature selection and allowing the model to focus only on the most important predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This constraint on coefficient size simplifies the model, reducing its tendency to memorize the training data and helping it generalize better to unseen data. By focusing on essential relationships, regularization leads the model to capture the overall trend or signal in the data, rather than noise, enhancing its robustness and predictive power across different datasets."
