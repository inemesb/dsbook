    "## General\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of **regression** is to model the relationship between a **dependent variable** (output) and one or more **independent variables** (inputs). This is one of the most common techniques in statistical modeling, helping us understand and predict the behavior of a dependent variable based on independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Independent and Dependent Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independent variable**: Denoted as $\\mathbf{x}_i$, these are the input variables or predictors.\n",
    "- **Dependent variable**: Denoted as $y_i$, this is the output variable or response we are trying to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Linear Regression model\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple case of a linear relationship, we want to find a function that models this relationship. One such model could be linear: $f(\\mathbf{x}_i) = a\\mathbf{x}_i + b$, where $a$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalize this model as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",

    "- $\\mathbf{x}_i' = (1, \\mathbf{x}_i^T)^T$ is the extended input vector including a constant 1 for the intercept,\n",
    "- The goal is to find $\\beta$ that best fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression, the **residual** for each data point is the difference between the observed value $y_i$ and the value predicted by the model $f(\\mathbf{x}_i)$. The residual for the $i$-th point can be written as:\n",

    "Residuals give us a way to evaluate how well the model fits the data. A smaller residual indicates that the model's prediction is close to the actual value, while a larger residual suggests a larger error."

The derivative of $f$ with respect to $\\beta$, denoted as $f'(\\beta)$, gives the slope of the function at any point $\\beta$. Gradient descent updates $\\beta$ iteratively in the opposite direction of $f'(\\beta)$ to move toward the minimum:\n",

    "### Polynomial Kernels as Basis Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we explored linear regression and saw that the goal is to minimize a **loss function** (such as the sum of squared residuals) to obtain the best-fit model. This concept is central to regression tasks, regardless of whether the model is linear or non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "One powerful approach for non-linear regression is to use **polynomial basis functions**. Polynomial regression can be thought of as applying a kernel transformation to the data by creating higher-order polynomial terms, such as $x^2$, $x^3$, and so on. These terms allow us to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of fitting a linear model $y = a x + b$, we can fit a polynomial of degree $n$, which effectively transforms the input space into a higher-dimensional space where the relationship between $x$ and $y$ may be linear, even if the relationship appears non-linear in the original space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, **polynomial kernels**  can be used to implicitly transform the data without explicitly computing the higher-dimensional features. In kernel-based models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or kernel ridge regression, a polynomial kernel can be used to fit more complex functions to the data while still employing the same optimization techniques as in linear regression."

    "We can further extend this concept by introducing other types of kernel functions, such as **Gaussian kernels**. These kernels, also known as **radial basis functions (RBF)**, allow us to capture localized, non-linear behavior in the data. In essence, Gaussian kernels provide a more flexible model that can handle highly non-linear patterns.\n",

    "### Unifying Loss Minimization Across Models\n",
    "\n",
    "What is essential in all these models—whether linear, polynomial, or Gaussian—is that we continue to use the same framework of **minimizing a loss function** to find the best-fit parameters. The kernel-based approach simply transforms the input space, allowing us to apply non-linear transformations without changing the fundamental concept of minimizing error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we will explore **more advanced loss functions** and **regularization techniques**, which help control model complexity and prevent overfitting, particularly important in high-dimensional kernel-transformed spaces."
