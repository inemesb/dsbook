    "# Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression, we typically aim to predict a continuous outcome (like a numerical value). However, we can extend the same concepts of regression to **classification tasks**, where the goal is to predict a discrete class label. By using specific target values (like $y = \\pm 1$), we can transform regression into a method for classifying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll explore how regression-based techniques can be adapted to solve classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Concept of Classification with Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification, the target variable $y_i$ represents the class label. For binary classification, we often use the labels $y_i = +1$ and $y_i = 0$ (or $y_i = -1$) to represent the two different classes. The goal is to assign the correct class to new data points based on features $\\mathbf{x}_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can approach this problem similarly to regression by fitting a function $f(\\mathbf{x})$, but instead of predicting a continuous variable, we focus on predicting whether $f(\\mathbf{x})$ is positive or negative:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $f(\\mathbf{x}) > 0$, predict class $+1$.\n",
    "- If $f(\\mathbf{x}) < 0$, predict class $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved by minimizing a **loss function**, which represents the error between the predicted values and the true class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification Loss Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying regression techniques to classification, the choice of loss function is critical. In regression, we typically minimize the **sum of squared residuals**, but in classification, we use loss functions that are designed to penalize misclassifications propotional to how much the predictor insists on the incorrect prediction. Below are three common loss functions used in classification tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hinge Loss (Used in Support Vector Machines)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **hinge loss** is commonly used in support vector machines (SVMs) and is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{hinge}} = \\sum_i \\max(0, 1 - y_i f(\\mathbf{x}_i))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This loss penalizes any data points where the predicted value $f(\\mathbf{x}_i)$ does not match the true label $y_i$. If $y_i f(\\mathbf{x}_i) \\geq 1$, the prediction is correct and there is no penalty. If $y_i f(\\mathbf{x}_i) < 1$, there is a penalty proportional to the misclassification."
