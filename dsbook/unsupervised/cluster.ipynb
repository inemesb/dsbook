    "# Unsupervised Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised machine learning aims to learn patterns from data without predefined labels. Specifically, the goal is to learn a function $f(x)$ from the dataset $D = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\}$ by optimizing an objective function $g(D, f)$, or by simply partitioning the dataset $D$. This chapter provides an overview of clustering methods, which are a core part of unsupervised machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is a technique used to partition data into distinct groups, where data points in the same group share similar characteristics. Clustering can be broadly categorized into **hard clustering** and **soft (fuzzy) clustering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard Clustering**: In hard clustering, each data point is assigned to a single cluster. This means that each data point belongs exclusively to one group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Soft (Fuzzy) Clustering**: In soft clustering, a data point can belong to multiple clusters with different probabilities. This allows for a more nuanced assignment, where data points can have partial membership across clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## k-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common clustering algorithms is **k-Means**. It is a hard clustering algorithm that aims to partition the dataset into $k$ clusters by iteratively refining the cluster assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Overview\n",
    "- **Cluster Centers**: The cluster center $\\mathbf{m}_i$ is defined as the arithmetic mean of all the data points belonging to the cluster.\n",
    "- **Distance Metric**: Typically, the distance metric used is Euclidean distance, defined as $||\\mathbf{x}_p - \\mathbf{m}_i||^2$.\n",
    "- **Cluster Assignment**: Each data point is assigned to the nearest cluster center:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$S_i^{(t)} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_p: ||\\mathbf{x}_p - \\mathbf{m}_i^{(t)}||^2 \\le ||\\mathbf{x}_p - \\mathbf{m}_j^{(t)}||^2 \\; \\forall j \\}$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Recalculation of Cluster Centers**: The cluster centers are recalculated based on the new assignments:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\\mathbf{m}_i^{(t+1)} = \\frac{1}{|S_i^{(t)}|} \\sum_{\\mathbf{x}_j \\in S_i^{(t)}} \\mathbf{x}_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps are repeated until the cluster centers converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Illustrations of k-Means\n",

EM is powerful because it allows us to infer both the **cluster membership** of data points and, in more complex models, the **internal structure** of each cluster, such as its shape and spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "For clustering tasks, latent variables can represent two main types of information:\n",
    "1. **Cluster Membership**: This latent variable indicates which cluster each data point belongs to. In simpler models like k-means, cluster membership is treated as a discrete, \"hard\" assignment, meaning each data point is assigned entirely to one cluster. In more flexible models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), cluster membership is a \"soft\" assignment, where each data point has a probability of belonging to each cluster.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Cluster Structure**: In GMMs and other probabilistic models, latent variables also describe the **covariance structure** within each cluster. This structure, captured by covariance matrices, allows each cluster to have its own unique shape and orientation, enabling the model to represent elliptical clusters or clusters with different spreads and dependencies between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EM Algorithm and Cluster Membership\n",
    "\n",
    "In models like **k-means**, cluster membership is binary: each data point is assigned fully to one cluster. This approach can be understood within the EM framework by treating cluster membership as a discrete probability distribution with values of 0 or 1, indicating hard assignments. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- **k-Means** can be considered a special case of the EM algorithm**, where each point is assigned entirely to the nearest cluster (E-Step), and then the cluster centroids are updated (M-Step) to minimize the total within-cluster variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more sophisticated models like GMMs, cluster membership is \"soft,\" with each data point partially assigned to each cluster based on probability. This approach gives greater flexibility in representing clusters with overlapping regions and assigning partial membership to data points near cluster boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the EM Algorithm Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The EM algorithm iteratively performs two key steps to refine both the cluster membership and the internal structure of each cluster:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expectation (E) Step**: In this step, based on the current estimates of the model parameters, we calculate the probability that each data point belongs to each cluster. This probability can be binary in k-means, where each point is assigned exclusively to one cluster, or continuous in GMMs, where each point is assigned a probability for each cluster. This step provides an estimate of the latent variables related to cluster membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maximization (M) Step**: Given the updated cluster memberships, we then re-estimate the model parameters to maximize the likelihood of observing the data. In k-means, this involves updating the cluster centroids. In GMMs, we not only update the mean of each cluster but also its **covariance matrix**, which captures the spread and orientation of each Gaussian component. This covariance matrix is essential in GMMs because it enables clusters to be elliptical and oriented in any direction, capturing richer relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Gaussian Mixture Models and Covariance as Latent Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider data that you suspect comes from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, each with its own unique shape and spread. In this case, the latent variables include both:\n",
    "   - **Cluster Membership**: The probability that each data point was generated by each Gaussian component, providing a \"soft\" assignment of data points to clusters.\n",
    "   - **Cluster Covariance**: The covariance matrix of each Gaussian component, which describes the shape, size, and orientation of each cluster, allowing the model to capture dependencies and correlations among variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the EM algorithm in this setting, you would:\n",
    "   - Start with initial guesses for the parameters of each Gaussian component, including its mean and covariance matrix.\n",
    "   - **E-Step**: Compute the probability of each data point belonging to each Gaussian based on the current parameters. These probabilities act as \"soft\" assignments for cluster membership.\n",
    "   - **M-Step**: Update the parameters for each Gaussian component, including the mean and covariance matrix, by maximizing the likelihood of observing the data with these updated assignments. The covariance matrix captures the internal structure, making it possible to model elliptical clusters and handle varying cluster sizes and orientations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this iterative process, the EM algorithm provides estimates for both the cluster memberships and the structural parameters (mean and covariance), refining our understanding of the hidden cluster structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EM Algorithm’s Flexibility Beyond Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "The EM algorithm’s iterative process of refining latent variables and model parameters is useful in many contexts beyond clustering:\n",
    "- In **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**, the latent variables represent the hidden states that underlie observed sequences.\n",
    "- In **factor analysis**, latent variables might represent hidden factors that explain correlations among observed variables.\n",
    "- In **topic modeling**, latent variables capture hidden themes within documents, providing probabilistic assignments of words to topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the EM algorithm is a versatile approach that adapts to models of various complexities. By handling both discrete and continuous latent variables, EM enables us to model both simple cluster assignments, as in k-means, and richer, continuous structural relationships, as in GMMs. This ability to estimate hidden structures and dependencies makes EM a foundational tool in probabilistic modeling and unsupervised learning.\n",
