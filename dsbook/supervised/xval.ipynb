    "## The Importance of Independent Validation Sets in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, the use of independent validation sets is crucial for evaluating model performance and avoiding one of the most common pitfalls: overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is trained to perform exceptionally well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. This typically happens when the model is excessively complex for the given task or when it memorizes the noise and peculiarities of the training dataset instead of learning the underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "An independent validation set helps to detect overfitting by providing a dataset that is separate from the training set, allowing for an unbiased evaluation of the model’s performance. Moreover, selecting the model that performs best on an independent validation set ensures that we are choosing a model that is most likely to generalize well to new data, rather than simply performing well on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To split data into training and validation sets, scikit-learn provides a convenient method called `train_test_split`. This function allows us to easily partition the data into training and test sets, ensuring that we have separate data to evaluate the model before proceeding with more advanced validation techniques. By default, `train_test_split` uses 75% of the data for training and 25% for testing, but this can be adjusted using the `test_size` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we create a small dataset of 10 data points, and we compare the performance of two polynomial regression models—a simple linear model and an overfitted higher-order polynomial model."

    "In the above code, we create a simple quadratic dataset, and fit both a linear regression model, a second-degree polynomial model, and an eighth-degree polynomial model. We also split the dataset into training and validation sets using `train_test_split`. The linear model appears to miss an important trend in the data and is hence underfitting. The eighth-degree model fits the training data almost perfectly, capturing all of the data points and the noise, but it is unlikely to perform well on new data—an example of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross Validation to the Rescue\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with reserving data for a separate validation set is that we have to reserve precious data for either training or testing. Ideally, one would like to train and test on as much data as possible. To evaluate how well a model will perform on new, unseen data, it’s important to use validation techniques such as cross validation. Cross validation is a strategy that partitions the available data into multiple subsets, or folds, allowing the model to be trained on one subset and validated on another. This ensures that each data point is eventually used both for training and validation. The method allows us to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data, providing an estimate of the expected accuracy on new samples -- still using all available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **k-fold cross validation**, the dataset is split into `k` equally sized folds. The model is trained `k` times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining folds for training. The average of the validation metrics across all folds gives a more robust estimate of the model's performance compared to using a single validation set.\n",
